# _ASCII in the A.M._
Guidelines, resources, and prompts for making ASCII art with code
This portion of the event goes from 10am to 1:00pm.

At 1:00pm we will begin judging.

## What is ASCII and what is ASCII art?
>"ASCII art uses computer characters (like letters, numbers, punctuation, or any other symbol that can be produced via text entry) instead of pixels to produce images. Old style emoticons like :-) are an early form of ASCII art, though it predates digital computers as typewriter art and continues today in a beautiful variety of forms."

—JP LeBreton, developer of [Playscii](http://vectorpoem.com/playscii/)

## What to do
Text processing and formatting are very important parts of programming and data analytics.

For the ASCII section of today's **_hackathon_** you can pursue any project you'd like that deals with outputting ASCII in some way.

That may seem broad, so here are some prompts if you'd like more direction ↓

## Prompts
1. Try to recreate the historical Print 10 program that prints these interesting patterns with only two characters.

2. Take a favorite text of yours from somewhere—whether a [novel](http://www.gutenberg.org/) or a [poem](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/)—and programmatically format it to fit the content.
You could try:
- alignment
- letter-spacing
- decoration
- changing casing, i.e, make all titles uppercase

3. Make an emoticon generator that combines different punctuation into thousands of different emoticons
4. You remember that project you finished just before the deadline with no comments? Go back and add comments, but get creative! Consider adding illustrations of your code or decoration to your comments.

5. Grow an ASCII garden! (example) Can you animate it?

## Tips
Make sure to use a monospaced font like courier or courier new. A monospaced font is one where all the characters are the same width.

For Java, feel free to just output to the console. Alternatively, you can use Java's GUI system.
